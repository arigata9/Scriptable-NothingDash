# Scriptable-NothingDash
Some Scriptable widgets with the Nothing design

## What's included

This repository included multiple scripts. Choose whichever you like.
* Nothing clock (Just for visuals, due to restrictions in iOS, Scriptable is not capable of refreshing widgets in real time)
* NothingNextEventsSmall (Shows the next calendar items for two configured calendars)
* NothingNextEventsWide (Same as above, but configured to be in medium size / wide)

## About the font...
Of course Nothing's font is not included within iOS.
The font used in these widgets is [this one](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2095104/nothing-font-5x7)

I used an App called "iFont" to integrate the font into iOS. The advantage is, that this app adds it using configuration profiles.
That way it stays on your device, even if you choose to delete the app again.

Of course you're free to change the font to something else. But this was made solely to look like Nothing's widgets :)

## One more thing..
Please don't forget to change the variables to your calendar names etc.
I am currently working on one more widget, which shows weather data too, which will need an API key for OpenWeatherMap.
